    "I'd like to try using artifical neural networks to classify unknown neurons in the *kato dataset*. In addition to being a classification task, this will also be a  **combinatorial optimization task** in that the classification needs to be optimal across all unknown neurons in the dataset. Brute force would go through every possibility and find the one with the least error. That of course is unfeasible when you have, say 50 unknown neurons which makes for a massive search space of $50!=30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000$\n",
